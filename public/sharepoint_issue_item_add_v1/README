=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web 
Services to create a new issue in an Issue Tracking list. After configuring 
Savon to work with the given account credentials, a few inputted values are 
checked for validity while the parameters for 'Assigned To' is modified to fit 
SharePoint standards. Priority and Issue Status are both values that are picked
out of a dropdown list, with '(2) Normal' and 'Acitve' as their respective
default values. Next, the Batch XML structure is built to give the Web Service 
the information it needs to create the new issue, which is then passed via
a SOAP call to SharePoint, where the issue is created. Any errors that
occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint site being accessed
needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
