=== Detailed Description
This handler create a file that is then uploaded to a SharePoint document 
library using an HTTP Put method call. Before making the call, the handler
appends an extension to the file (if necessary). It then uses the given
parameters to form the URL where the new file will be uploaded to. Lastly,
the call is made (using the Rest Client gem) and the file is created and 
uploaded to the specified SharePoint document library. If the document library 
has versioning enabled, a duplicate file name will be uploaded as a new version
and the file will be overwritten if versioning is disabled (versioning is 
disabled by default in new libraries). Any errors that occur during this process 
will be caught and re-raised by the handler. Authentication is done through SSL, 
so the SharePoint site being accessed needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
