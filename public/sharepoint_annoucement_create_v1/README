=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web 
Services to create a new announcement in an Announcement list. Savon is then
configured to work with the given account credentials. Next, the Batch XML 
structure is built to give the Web Service the information it needs to create 
the new announcement, which is then passed via a SOAP call to SharePoint, where 
the announcement is created and posted to the list. Any errors that occur during 
this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler. Authentication is done 
through SSL, so the SharePoint site being accessed needs to be setup to allow 
SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
