=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web 
Services to get the contents of a list from a specific SharePoint 
site. As long as the user has sufficient privileges, the first call to 
SharePoint returns a hash containing all of the Site lists and their 
details. The handler then uses that list to get the correct list id that
corresponds with the list title given during input and then makes another
SOAP call to get the the list contents which are returned in a hash. The 
handler then takes that response, cleans up the hash, and then converts it 
to a JSON table to allow for easy access of the information. Any errors 
that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint site being accessed 
needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
