== Sharepoint_Site_Create
This handler adds a new Site to a SharePoint top level site.

=== Parameters
[Title]
  The title of the new Site.
[URL]
  The URL that will identify the new site. This new URL will be appended to 
  the top level URL, so the final URL will have the form of 
  http://homepage_url/new_sites_url.
[Description]
  A description of the new Site.
[Site Template]
  The site template that will be used for the new Site. Will be chosen from the
  drop down list.

=== Results
This handler does not return any results.

==== Sample Configuration
Title:                   Testing Handler
URL:                     testinghandler
Description:             This Site was created from a handler
Site Template:           Blank Site 

=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web Services to 
create a new site under the given homepage url. After configuring Savon to 
work with the given account credentials (make sure that the account has
permission to create a site), the Site Template value is modified so SharePoint 
will recognize it. The inputted information is then passed to SharePoint via a 
SOAP call, where the Site is created with the given url appended to the homepage 
url. The newly created Site will not appear in the quick launch or top link bar 
of the parent website, so it will be needed to manually added before it shows up 
there. Any errors that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by 
the handler. Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint site being 
accessed needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
