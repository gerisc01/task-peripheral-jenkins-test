=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web 
Services to create a new event in a SharePoint calendar. After 
configuring Savon to work with the given account credentials, a few
inputted values are checked for validity while the time parameters are
configured so that SharePoint will recognize them. Next, the Batch XML 
structure is built to give the Web Service the information it needs to 
create the new event, which is then passed via a SOAP call to SharePoint, 
where the event is created on the specified calendar. Any errors that
occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint site being accessed
needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
