=== Detailed Description
This handler uploads a file to a SharePoint document library using an 
HTTP Put method call. Before making the call, the handler builds the url based
on the inputted parameters. This url is the location where the file will be 
uploaded to. The call is then made using the Rest Client gem and the file is 
uploaded to the specified SharePoint document library. If the document library 
has versioning enabled, a duplicate file name will be uploaded as a new version
and the file will be overwritten if versioning is disabled (versioning is 
disabled by default in new libraries). Any errors that occurs during this process 
will be caught and re-raised by the handler. Authentication is done through SSL, 
so the SharePoint site being accessed needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the Sharepoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to get the Homepage URL
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the Sharepoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. Using the example below, the url that would be
inputted is "https://sharepoint.company.com/development", where "development"
is the sub-site and "sharepoint.compnay.com" is the base site.

* Parameter Example
https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
