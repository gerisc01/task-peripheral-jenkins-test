=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the SharePoint Web Services to 
create a new contact in a Contact list. Savon is then configured to work with 
the given account credentials. Next the Batch XML structure is built to give 
the Web Service the information it needs to create the new contact, which is 
then passed via a SOAP call to SharePoint, where the contact is created and 
posted to the list. Any errors that occur during this process will be caught and 
re-raised by the handler. Authentication is done through SSL, so the SharePoint 
site being accessed needs to be setup to allow SSL connections.

* Make sure the SharePoint Web Services database is turned on.

=== How to Obtain the Homepage URL Info Value
To find the homepage url, all you have to do is look at the URL of any
page on the SharePoint site. The url that should be inputted should
contain both the base url (the top-most site in the collection) and the
sub-site that you are on. For example, given the following URL:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development/SitePages/Home.aspx
The base site is "sharepoint.company.com", the sub-site is "development"
and the 'HomePage URL' task info values should be set to:
  https://sharepoint.company.com/development
